<p>The first puzzle section you encounter after taking a left through the first gate has an audiotape sitting on the ground next to it.</p>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">
Fromerly you appeared to me, O Lord,
as invisible by every creature

because you are a hidden, infinite God.

Infinity, however, is incomprehensible
by every means of comprehending.

Later you appeared to me as visible by all,
for a thing exists only as you see it,

and it would not actually exist unless it saw you.

For your vision confers being,
since your vision is your essence.

Thus, my God, you are equally invisible and visible.
As you are, you are invisible;

as the creature is,
which exists only insofar as the creature sees you,
you are visible.

You, therefore, my invisible God, are seen by all,
and in all sight you are seen by everyone who sees.

You who are invisible,
who are both absolute from everything visible
and infinitely superexalted,

are seen in every visible thing
and in every act of vision.

Therefore, I must leap across this wall of invisible vision
to where you are to be found.

But this wall is both everything and nothing.
For you, who confront
as if you were both all things and nothing at all,

dwell inside that high wall
which no natural ability can scale by its own power.
<br />---<br />

<p>Just after passing through the second gate on the island hang left to find a side-path to a shaded area, and an audiotape resting on the ground.</p>

<!-- <span style="color: blue">Group Discussion: After listening to the tape, write down a brief reflection in response to what you heard.</span> -->

<p><button onclick="collapseExcerpt2()">View Excerpt</button></p>

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">
One nature, perfect and pervading,
circulates in all natures;

One reality, all-comprehensive,
contains within itself all realities.

The one Moon reflects itself
wherever there is a sheet of water,

And all the moons in the waters
are embraced within the one Moon.

The Absolute of all the Buddhas
enters into my own being,

And my own being is found
in union with theirs....

The Inner Light is beyond praise and blame;
Like space it knows no boundaries,

Yet it is even here, within us,
ever retaining its serenity and fullness.

It is only when you hunt for it that you lose it;

You cannot take hold of it,
but equally you cannot get rid of it,

And while you can do neither,
it goes on its own way.

You remain silent and it speaks;
you speak, and it is dumb.

The great gate of charity is wide open,
with no obstacles before it.
<br />---<br />

<p><strong>Final Journal Requirement:</strong></p>

<p>After responding to one of the items above, discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle  in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle.</p>

<!-- As you reflect on your experiences in The Witness from this week, alongside class discussion, lecture, and readings, consider including responses to the <span style="color: blue">prompts in blue</span> as a starting point, as well as your own thoughts, questions, observations, and connections.

Contemplate including in your responses observations on the puzzle mechanics and game design of the environment in this week's section of puzzles. What interesting environmental clues and insights did you uncover in this area of the game? What lessons, or creative discoveries from previous island sections may have helped or hindered your completion of this week's challenges, and in what way did they effect your understanding of this week's puzzles?

Additionally, consider how responses can include your interpretation of in-game quotes from audio recorders and how these quotes might relate to puzzles or ideas from a certain area of The Witness island. Further steps could be taken to research the famous figures behind these audio recorder quotes to learn more about their backgrounds and how their philosophies intertwine with the lessons in this game. -->
