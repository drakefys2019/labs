<p>An audio log excerpt from B.F. Skinner’s 1971 book, <a href="https://selfdefinition.org/psychology/BF-Skinner-Beyond-Freedom-&amp;-Dignity-1971.pdf">“Beyond Freedom and Dignity”</a>, can be found just to the right of this spilled bucket.</p>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">
"In the traditional view a person is free.
He is autonomous in the sense that his behavior is uncaused...

That view, together with its associated practices,
must be re-examined when a scientific analysis

reveals unexpected controlling relations
between behavior and environment....

By questioning the control exercised by autonomous man
and demonstrating the control exercised by the environment,

a science of behavior also seems to question dignity or worth.

A person is responsible for his behavior,
not only in the sense that he may be
justly blamed or punished when he behaves badly,

but also in the sense that he is to be given credit
and admired for his achievements.

A scientific analysis shifts the credit as well as the blame
to the environment,
and traditional practices can then no longer be justified.

These are sweeping changes,
and those who are committed to traditional theories and practices
naturally resist them....

As the emphasis shifts to the environment,
the individual seems to be exposed
to a new kind of danger.

Who is to construct the controlling environment
and to what end?

Autonomous man presumably controls himself
in accordance with a built-in set of values;
and will it be good for those he controls?

Answers to questions of this sort are said, of course,
to call for value judgements."

I boasted among men that I had known you.

They see your pictures in all works of mine.
They come and ask me, "Who is he?"

I know not how to answer them.
I say, "Indeed, I cannot tell."

They blame me and they go away in scorn.
And you sit there smiling.

I put my tales of you into lasting songs.
The secret gushes out from my heart.

They come and ask me,
"Tell me all your meanings."

I know not how to answer them.
I say, "Ah, who knows what they mean!"

They smile and go away in utter scorn.
And you sit there smiling.
