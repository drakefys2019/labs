<p>Climb atop a shiny structure to the north of the main ruins to discover an audio log excerpt of Albert Einstein reflecting on “cosmic religious feeling”.</p>

<p><button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button></p>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">

"I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling
is the strongest and the noblest motive for scientific research.
Only those who realize the immense efforts
and, above all, the devotion
without which pioneer work in theoretical science
cannot be achieved
are able to grasp the strength of the emotion
out of which alone such work,
remote as it is from the immediate realities of life, can issue.
What a deep conviction of the rationality of the universe
and what a yearning to understand,
were it but a feeble reflection
of the mind revealed in this world,
Kepler and Newton must have had
to enable them to spend years of solitary labor
in disentangling the principles of celestial mechanics!
Those whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results
easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality
of the men who, surrounded by a skeptical world,
have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered wide
through the world and through the centuries.
Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends
can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men
and given them strength to remain true to their purpose
in spite of countless failures.
It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man such strength.
A contemporary has said, not unjustly
that in this materialistic age of ours
the serious scientific workers
are the only profoundly religious people."

<h3 id="journal-assignment">Journal Assignment</h3>

<p>Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Your journal entry must include discussions on at least (2) of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h5 id="any-one-of-the-blue-prompts-from-this-lab">Any one of the <span style="color: blue">blue prompts</span> from this lab</h5>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h5 id="a-discovery-you-made-about-the-nature-of-the-island">A discovery you made about the nature of the island</h5>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5 id="an-aha-moment-you-had-while-solving-any-of-the-puzzles">An “aha!” moment you had while solving any of the puzzles</h5>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5 id="do-you-have-a-theory-on-what-the-purpose-of-this-game-is-explain-it">Do you have a theory on what the purpose of this game is? Explain it.</h5>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h5 id="are-any-of-the-audio-logs-meaningful-to-you-if-yes-explain-why">Are any of the audio logs meaningful to you? If yes, explain why.</h5>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Final Journal Requirement:</strong></p>

<p>Discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. How does this puzzle work? If it helps, feel free to include a screenshot or sketch of the puzzle.</p>

<!-- As you reflect on your experiences in The Witness from this week, alongside class discussion, lecture, and readings, consider including responses to the <span style="color: blue">prompts in blue</span> as a starting point, as well as your own thoughts, questions, observations, and connections.

Contemplate including in your responses observations on the puzzle mechanics and game design of the environment in this week's section of puzzles. What interesting environmental clues and insights did you uncover in this area of the game? What lessons, or creative discoveries from previous island sections may have helped or hindered your completion of this week's challenges, and in what way did they effect your understanding of this week's puzzles?

Additionally, consider how responses can include your interpretation of in-game quotes from audio recorders and how these quotes might relate to puzzles or ideas from a certain area of The Witness island. Further steps could be taken to research the famous figures behind these audio recorder quotes to learn more about their backgrounds and how their philosophies intertwine with the lessons in this game. -->
