# Desert Ruins

Just North of Symmetry Island, a bleached pile of ruins sits smoldering in the bright sunlight.

### Catching Reflected Light
As you traverse the desert ruins, consider how the Sun reflects brightly off various surfaces.

### Controlling Machinery
Many of the puzzles in this area can be more easily solved by activating the technology in the environment. Try adjusting this monitor's position by controlling the switch.

### [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)

Climb atop a shiny structure to the north of the main ruins to discover an audio log excerpt of Albert Einstein reflecting on "cosmic religious feeling".

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">

"I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling
is the strongest and the noblest motive for scientific research.
Only those who realize the immense efforts
and, above all, the devotion
without which pioneer work in theoretical science
cannot be achieved
are able to grasp the strength of the emotion
out of which alone such work,
remote as it is from the immediate realities of life, can issue.
What a deep conviction of the rationality of the universe
and what a yearning to understand,
were it but a feeble reflection
of the mind revealed in this world,
Kepler and Newton must have had
to enable them to spend years of solitary labor
in disentangling the principles of celestial mechanics!
Those whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results
easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality
of the men who, surrounded by a skeptical world,
have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered wide
through the world and through the centuries.
Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends
can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men
and given them strength to remain true to their purpose
in spite of countless failures.
It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man such strength.
A contemporary has said, not unjustly
that in this materialistic age of ours
the serious scientific workers
are the only profoundly religious people."

### Limited Light

Journey down into the depths of the ruins, leaving behind the scorched sands above.

### Completing The Island
This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

### The Witness Journal Entry #2

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Your journal entry must include discussions on at least (1) of the following:

- ##### **A Puzzling Puzzle**
  - ##### After reflecting on a puzzle in this area, what was most confusing about it and why? Are there still aspects of the puzzle you don't understand? Explain.
  - ##### What approaches or techniques did you use to improve your understanding of the puzzle?
  - ##### Describe the feelings you experienced as you worked through your confusion to ultimately solve the puzzle.
- ##### **Discovering The Nature of The Island**
  - ##### What other signs of life or existence did you discover in this area that give clues to the nature of the island? Explain.
  - ##### Reflect on a part of the environment you found beautiful or strange. Why did it capture your attention? If it helps, you may include a screenshot here in addition (not substitution) to your written work.
  <!-- - ##### -->
- ##### **Experiencing An "Aha!" Moment**
  - ##### Did you have an "Aha!" moment while you were attempting to solve any particular puzzle? Describe the moment when you finally figured it out.
  - ##### How do you think other puzzles in the area informed your approach to solving this one?
  - ##### How has your perception and understanding of the puzzle changed once you found the solution?
- ##### **The Purpose of The Game**
  - ##### Do you have a theory on what the purpose of this game is? Explain it.
  - ##### Why are you here?
  - ##### What lessons have you taken away from playing this game so far?
- ##### **Environmental Entwinement**
  - ##### Describe an aspect of the environment that improved your understanding of the puzzles.
  - ##### In what way did the environment assist you in understanding the nature of a given puzzle?
  - ##### How might the environment reflect properties of a puzzle or puzzles?
  - ##### How might this area's puzzles reflect aspects of the environment?
  - ##### Does the environment play a part in solving these puzzles? Explain the environment's role in this area, and how you discovered it.
- ##### **Audio Log Reflections**
  - ##### Respond to the content of an audio log in this area. In your own words, explain the message behind the content of the log. What is the speaker trying to say? Do you agree with him or her?
  - ##### Why do you think these audio log(s) were chosen for this location of the game?
  - ##### In what way do the audio log(s) relate to the puzzles in this area?

**Final Journal Requirement:**

After responding to one of the items above, discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle  in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle.
