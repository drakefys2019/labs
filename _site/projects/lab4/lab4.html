<p>Follow a hidden, rocky path to the left of the logging building to find this audio log excerpt of David Darling’s 1996 book, <a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/books.html">Zen Physics: The Science of Death, The Logic of Reincarnation</a>.</p>

<p><button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button></p>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">
In a sense, what modern physics is to the history of Western thought,
Zen is to the development of the Eastern worldview:

the ultimate refinement of more than two thousand years
of incisive debate, discussion, and critical development.  

Yet the difference between the two could hardly be more marked.

Whereas physics is interested above all
in theories, concepts, and formulas,
Zen values only the concrete and the simple.

Zen wants facts — not in the Western sense of things
that are measurable and numerical (which are, in fact, abstractions!)
but as living, immediate, and tangible.

Its approach to understanding is not to theorize
because it recognizes that previously accumulated ideas and knowledge —

in other words, memories of all kinds —
block the direct perception of reality.

Therefore, Zen adopts an unusual approach.
Its buildup involves language — which is unavoidable.

Any method, even if it turns out to be an anti-method,
has first to convey some background in order to be effective.

But the way Zen uses language is always to point
beyond language, beyond concepts to the concrete.

David Darling, 1996

Sixty-six times have these eyes beheld the changing
scene of autumn.

I have said enough about moonlight,
Ask no more.

Only listen to the voice of pines and cedars when no
wind stirs.

<p><span style="color: blue">What might Ryonen mean when she says, “Only listen to the voice of pines and cedars when no wind stirs.” Is light perhaps this voice when no wind stirs the trees?</span></p>

<h3 id="completing-lab-4">Completing Lab 4</h3>

<p>This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!</p>

<p><img src="captures/laser_capture.jpg#capture" alt="Laser Capture Image" /></p>

<h3 id="written-response">Written Response</h3>

<p>To received full points for this lab, write a 300-word (or more) reflection on what you learned from completing this part of the island.</p>

<p>As you reflect on your experiences in The Witness from this week, alongside class discussion, lecture, and readings, consider including responses to the <span style="color: blue">prompts in blue</span> as a starting point, as well as your own thoughts, questions, observations, and connections.</p>

<p>Contemplate including in your responses observations on the puzzle mechanics and game design of the environment in this week’s section of puzzles. What interesting environmental clues and insights did you uncover in this area of the game? What lessons, or creative discoveries from previous island sections may have helped or hindered your completion of this week’s challenges, and in what way did they effect your understanding of this week’s puzzles?</p>

<p>Additionally, consider how responses can include your interpretation of in-game quotes from audio recorders and how these quotes might relate to puzzles or ideas from a certain area of The Witness island. Further steps could be taken to research the famous figures behind these audio recorder quotes to learn more about their backgrounds and how their philosophies intertwine with the lessons in this game.</p>
