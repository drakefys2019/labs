<p>Entering the jungle from the monastery, look to the path to discover two audio logs sitting on either side of the path. Consider this excerpt from Lao Tzu.</p>

We join spokes together in a wheel,
but it is the center hole
that makes the wagon move.

We shape clay into a pot,
but it is the emptiness inside
that holds whatever we want.

We hammer wood for a house,
but it is the inner space
that makes it livable.

We work with being,
but non-being is what we use.

<p><span style="color: blue">Group Discussion: Reflect on this notion of “being” and “non-being”.

The glass is transparent,

<div id="excerpt3" style="display:none">

If we were not able or did not desire to look in any new direction,
if we did not have a doubt or recognize ignorance,

we would not get any new ideas.  
There would be nothing worth checking,
because we would know what is true.  

So what we call scientific knowledge today
is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty.  

Some of them are most unsure; some of them are nearly sure;
but none is absolutely certain.  Scientists are used to this.  

We know that it is consistent to be able to live and not know.  

Some people say,
“How can you _live_ without knowing?” I do not know what they mean.

I always live without knowing.  That is easy.  
How you get to know is what I want to know.

This freedom to doubt is an important matter in the sciences
and, I believe, in other fields.  
It was born of a struggle.  

It was a struggle to be permitted to doubt, to be unsure.

And I do not want us to forget the importance of the struggle
and, by default, to let the thing fall away.  

I feel a responsibility as a scientist
who knows the great value
of a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance,

and the progress made possible by such a philosophy,
progress which is the fruit of freedom of thought.  

I feel a responsibility to proclaim the value of this freedom
and to teach that doubt is not to be feared,

but that it is to be welcomed
as the possibility of a new potential for human beings.

If you know that you are not sure,
you have a chance to improve the situation.  

I want to demand this freedom for future generations.

<br />---<br />
Richard Feynman, 1963
