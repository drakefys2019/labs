# Part A: The Glass Factory

Just West of our starting point, an abandoned glass factory may hold the key to accessing Symmetry Island.  

## <center>You Are Here</center>

Consider these aspects of the factory environment:

### Balance
Upon completing the factory door puzzle you enter into a room containing vase-like objects on pedestals.

<span style="color: blue">What do you notice about the relationships between these objects? As you complete the puzzles in the glass factory, consider the similarities between the symmetry of the control lines, and the symmetry in the forms of these objects.</span>

### Material
Observe how the tint of the glass plate affects the color of the sky in this shot.

<span style="color: blue">Take a screenshot of another element in the environment that seems to affect its surroundings.</span>

### Intuition
As you complete this section of the factory, consider how the melted glass affects your ability to solve the puzzle.

<span style="color: blue">Did you change your problem-solving technique as the glass grew progressively distorted? If so, what did you do differently to solve it?</span>

### Bonus Puzzle
This puzzle can be found tucked away on the roof of the factory.

<span style="color: blue">Jot down your current theory as to how these bonus puzzles work.</span>

Once you've completed the glass factory, follow the powered cord to Symmetry Island.

### Audiotape B1
The first puzzle section you encounter after taking a left through the first gate has an audiotape sitting on the ground next to it.

<span style="color: blue">After listening to the tape, write down a brief reflection in response to what you heard.</span>

### Perspective
Many of the puzzles on Symmetry Island require you to re-orient your view of the environment in order to decipher the solution.

<span style="color: blue">What strategies do you use to solve the puzzles when the solution is hidden from view?</span>

### Reflection
Reflection and symmetry play very important roles in many of the puzzles on this island.

<span style="color: blue">When solving puzzles with symmetric control-lines, do you try to solve for one line at a time, or both simultaneously? Do you consider one control-line the original, and the other its reflection?</span>

### Audiotape B2
Just after passing through the second gate on the island hang left to find a side-path to a shaded area, and an audiotape resting on the ground.

<span style="color: blue">After listening to the tape, write down a brief reflection in response to what you heard.</span>

### Completing The Island
This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

### Written Response

To received full points for this lab, write a ~1-2 page reflection on what you learned from completing this part of the island. Feel free to use the <span style="color: blue">prompts in blue</span> as a starting point for this response.
