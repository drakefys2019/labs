# Part A: The Quarry

Leave soft footprints in powdered stone as you meander through the puzzling interior of the quarry.

### Negated Calculations
The quarry offers insight into a new puzzle symbol.

<span style="color: blue">Group Discussion: What is the inferred meaning of this symbol?</span>

### Particular Partitions
Solve this puzzle to unlock a shortcut to the quarry rooftop.

<span style="color: blue">Group Discussion: How does this panel clearly illustrate the rules of partitioning and negating rules?</span>

### Tinted Tactics
Consider these two panel sections below:
<br>

Partitions from the quarry.
<br><br>

Explosion groupings from the logging facility.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 3B](captures/insight_3B.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Group Discussion: Though both of these puzzles utilize multiple colors and similar rules, solutions are quite different. How do your tactics differ in solving these two types of panels?</span>

### [Hugh Kingsmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Kingsmill)

Once stairway accessibility has been granted, examine the stone-carved figures to discover an audio log excerpt by Hugh Kingsmill on the divinity of humankind.

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none" markdown="1">

What is divine in man is elusive and impalpable,
and he is easily tempted to embody it in a concrete form –

a church, a country, a social system, a leader –
so that he may realize it with less effort
and serve it with more profit.

Yet the attempt to externalize the kingdom of heaven
in a temporal shape must end in disaster.

It cannot be created by charters or constitutions
nor established by arms.

Those who seek for it alone will reach it together,
and those who seek it in company will perish by themselves.

<br>---<br>
Hugh Kingsmill, 1944

### Bonus Puzzle
A familiar-looking discarded panel can be found tucked beneath the air ducts of the quarry rooftop.

# Part B: The Logging Facility

Step lightly through the shallows of the river's end and enter into the logging facility across from the quarry.

### Tested Recollection
To progress further into the pondering of the logging facility, complete each of these two challenging panels.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 4](captures/insight_4.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Group Discussion: What specific insights do these two panels test you on? How does an understanding of these rules inform your approach to the other puzzles in this facility?</span>

### Multitudinal Solutions
Puzzles in this area might be solved in more than one way.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 5](captures/insight_5.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Group Discussion: Can you find multiple solutions to any of these puzzles? Are there certain solutions that appear more obvious to you than others?</span>

### Apparent Constraints
In each of these puzzles, a rule must be ignored.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 6](captures/insight_6.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Group Discussion: What clues do these panels offer to guide you towards the correct solution? How do combinations of certain symbols dictate what can and cannot be done to solve the panel?</span>

### Completing Lab 9

This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

<!-- ### The Witness Journal Entry #10

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Choose one of the prompts below (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) to respond to in your journal entry.

1. ##### **Prominent Experience**

    - ##### Find and listen to all 4 audio log excerpts found in this area: (Note that some audio logs are hidden behind locked panels or alternate pathways.)
      - [William Wordsworth](#william-wordsworth)
      - [Niffari](#niffari)
      - [Rupert Brooke](#rupert-brooke)
      - [Gangaji](#gangaji)

    - ##### How does your chosen excerpt relate to your experience solving the treehouse puzzles? Explain.
    - ##### In what way does your chosen excerpt relate to your experience thus far playing The Witness? Explain.

2. ##### **Bridges to Understanding**
  - ##### The treehouse area has many lessons to teach. Discuss an insight you gained from completing the treehouse that has helped you to understand previous sections of the game you found confusing.
  - ##### How does the process of completing any bridge in the treehouse help to cement your understanding of the rules?
  - ##### Discuss a specific bridge in the treehouse area, why you found it particularly challenging, and what strategies lead to your ability to complete this section.

3. ##### **A False Impression**
  - ##### Describe a section of puzzles in the treehouse that turned out to be solvable in a way you first assumed would not work.
  - ##### Explain what first lead you to assume certain rules applied.
  - ##### How do the rules of this puzzle differ from your expectations? Explain.

4. ##### **Enigmatic Symbolism**
  - ##### Each section in the treehouse is full of symbolic combinations. Please list each symbol you encountered in completing the treehouse, and what rules each symbol conveys.
  - ##### For any given puzzle, how do the combinations of symbols add to the complexity of finding the solution?
  - ##### Describe a specific puzzle where the presence of certain symbols inhibited solving it in an ideal way or directed you toward a unique solution.

**Final Journal Requirement:**

After responding to one of the items above, discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle. -->
