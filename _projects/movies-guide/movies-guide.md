# **The Witness: Movie Theater**

![Header Image 1](captures/header.jpg#header)
# Chest and Movie Location Guide

There are 6 locations throughout the island of The Witness that contain a coded message, locked in a chest, behind a puzzle door. The information contained within each of these chests allows the player to view extended video sequences, similar to the audio logs, in a movie theater located underneath the windmill in the "Town" section of the island.

**To avoid giving away the answers for those interested in discovering the locations of the chests themselves, all vital content on this page is hidden behind a spoiler-button. Click the button at each section to reveal screenshots and information.**
