# **The Witness: Lab 04**

# Shady Trees

Across the lake from the monastery, rays of filtered sunlight cut through a patch of shaded trees, offering puzzling displays of luminance and shadow.

### Starting Point

The area's section of puzzles begins just beyond this rusty, orange door.

### [David Darling, 1996](http://www.daviddarling.info/)

Follow a hidden, rocky path to the left of the logging building to find this audio log excerpt of David Darling's 1996 book, [Zen Physics: The Science of Death, The Logic of Reincarnation](http://www.daviddarling.info/books.html).

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">
In a sense, what modern physics is to the history of Western thought,
Zen is to the development of the Eastern worldview:

the ultimate refinement of more than two thousand years
of incisive debate, discussion, and critical development.  

Yet the difference between the two could hardly be more marked.

Whereas physics is interested above all
in theories, concepts, and formulas,
Zen values only the concrete and the simple.

Zen wants facts — not in the Western sense of things
that are measurable and numerical (which are, in fact, abstractions!)
but as living, immediate, and tangible.

Its approach to understanding is not to theorize
because it recognizes that previously accumulated ideas and knowledge —

in other words, memories of all kinds —
block the direct perception of reality.

Therefore, Zen adopts an unusual approach.
Its buildup involves language — which is unavoidable.

Any method, even if it turns out to be an anti-method,
has first to convey some background in order to be effective.

But the way Zen uses language is always to point
beyond language, beyond concepts to the concrete.

### [Ryonen, 1711](https://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/RyonenGenso.html)

After gaining access to the interior of the gated laser area, turn around to see an audio log sitting on the wall.

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt2()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">

Sixty-six times have these eyes beheld the changing
scene of autumn.

I have said enough about moonlight,
Ask no more.

Only listen to the voice of pines and cedars when no
wind stirs.

### Completing Lab 4

This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

### The Witness Journal Entry #4

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Choose one of the prompts below (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) to respond to in your journal entry.

1. ##### **Compare, Contrast**
  - ##### Compare the puzzles in the shady trees area to those found in lab 1, 2 or 3.
  - ##### Identify lesson(s) learned from a previous lab that informed your approach to the shady trees puzzles.
  - ##### In what ways are these puzzle mechanics similar? In what ways are they different?

2. ##### **Trials and Tribulations**
  - ##### As you complete both sections of the shady trees, consider your thought process as you gradually come to understand the rules of this area.
  - ##### How does the left side of shady trees differ from the right side?
  - ##### Did knowledge from one section hinder your understanding of the other, or is there a collaborative lesson both sides teach together?

3. ##### **Helpful Hints**
  - ##### The shady trees sections of the island is covered in environmental clues. How do these clues lend you aid in solving the puzzles?
  - ##### Describe a situation in which these hints increased your confusion instead of your understanding.
  - ##### What additional information, crucial to solving these puzzles, is still missing? How did you derive this missing information?

4. ##### **Audio Log Reflections**
  - ##### Respond to the content of an audio log in this area. In your own words, explain the message behind the content of the log. What is the speaker trying to say? Do you agree with him or her?
  - ##### Why do you think these audio log(s) were chosen for this location of the game?
  - ##### In what way do the audio log(s) relate to the puzzles in this area?

**Final Journal Requirement:**

After responding to one of the items above, discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle.
