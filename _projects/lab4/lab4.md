# Shady Trees

Across the lake from the monastery, sun-rays cut through a patch of shady trees, offering puzzling displays of light and shadow.

### [David Darling, 1996](http://www.daviddarling.info/)

Follow a hidden, rocky path to the left of the logging building to find this audio log excerpt of David Darling's 1996 book, [Zen Physics: The Science of Death, The Logic of Reincarnation](http://www.daviddarling.info/books.html).

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">
In a sense, what modern physics is to the history of Western thought,
Zen is to the development of the Eastern worldview:

the ultimate refinement of more than two thousand years
of incisive debate, discussion, and critical development.  

Yet the difference between the two could hardly be more marked.

Whereas physics is interested above all
in theories, concepts, and formulas,
Zen values only the concrete and the simple.

Zen wants facts — not in the Western sense of things
that are measurable and numerical (which are, in fact, abstractions!)
but as living, immediate, and tangible.

Its approach to understanding is not to theorize
because it recognizes that previously accumulated ideas and knowledge —

in other words, memories of all kinds —
block the direct perception of reality.

Therefore, Zen adopts an unusual approach.
Its buildup involves language — which is unavoidable.

Any method, even if it turns out to be an anti-method,
has first to convey some background in order to be effective.

But the way Zen uses language is always to point
beyond language, beyond concepts to the concrete.

### [Ryonen, 1711](https://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/RyonenGenso.html)

After gaining access to the interior of the gated laser area, turn around to see an audio log sitting on the wall.

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">

Sixty-six times have these eyes beheld the changing
scene of autumn.

I have said enough about moonlight,
Ask no more.

Only listen to the voice of pines and cedars when no
wind stirs.

Ryonen, 1711

<span style="color: blue">What might Ryonen mean when she says, "Only listen to the voice of pines and cedars when no wind stirs." Is light perhaps this voice when no wind stirs the trees?</span>

### Completing Lab 4

This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!
