# Part A: The Glass Factory

Just West of our starting point, an abandoned glass factory may hold the key to accessing Symmetry Island.  

## <center>You Are Here</center>

Consider these aspects of the factory environment:

### Balance
Upon completing the factory door puzzle you enter into a room containing vase-like objects on pedestals.

<span style="color: blue">What do you notice about the relationships between these objects? As you complete the puzzles in the glass factory, consider the similarities between the symmetry of the control lines, and the symmetry in the forms of these objects.</span>

### Material
Observe how the tint of the glass plate affects the color of the sky in this shot.

<span style="color: blue">Are there other elements in the environment that seem to affect their surroundings?</span>

### Intuition
As you complete this section of the factory, consider how the melted glass affects your ability to solve the puzzle.

<span style="color: blue">Did you change your problem-solving technique as the glass grew progressively distorted? If so, what did you do differently to solve it?</span>

### Bonus Puzzle
This secret puzzle can be found tucked away on the roof of the factory.

<span style="color: blue">I wonder what simple lesson this puzzle is trying to convey...</span>

Once you've completed the glass factory, follow the powered cord to Symmetry Island.

### Perspective
Many of the puzzles on Symmetry Island require you to re-orient your view of the environment in order to decipher the solution.

<span style="color: blue">What strategies do you use to solve the puzzles when the solution is hidden from view?</span>

![Image B2](captures/capture_B2.jpg#capture)

### Reflection
Reflection and symmetry play very important roles in many of the puzzles on this island.

<span style="color: blue">When solving puzzles with symmetric control-lines, do you try to solve for one line at a time, or both simultaneously? Do you consider one control-line the original, and the other its reflection?</span>

### [Nicholas of Cusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_of_Cusa)

The first puzzle section you encounter after taking a left through the first gate has an audiotape sitting on the ground next to it.

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">
Fromerly you appeared to me, O Lord,
as invisible by every creature

because you are a hidden, infinite God.

Infinity, however, is incomprehensible
by every means of comprehending.

Later you appeared to me as visible by all,
for a thing exists only as you see it,

and it would not actually exist unless it saw you.

For your vision confers being,
since your vision is your essence.

Thus, my God, you are equally invisible and visible.
As you are, you are invisible;

as the creature is,
which exists only insofar as the creature sees you,
you are visible.

You, therefore, my invisible God, are seen by all,
and in all sight you are seen by everyone who sees.

You who are invisible,
who are both absolute from everything visible
and infinitely superexalted,

are seen in every visible thing
and in every act of vision.

Therefore, I must leap across this wall of invisible vision
to where you are to be found.

But this wall is both everything and nothing.
For you, who confront
as if you were both all things and nothing at all,

dwell inside that high wall
which no natural ability can scale by its own power.

Nicholas of Cusa, 1453

### [Yung-chia Ta-shih](http://www.greatthoughtstreasury.com/author/author-115)

Just after passing through the second gate on the island hang left to find a side-path to a shaded area, and an audiotape resting on the ground.

<span style="color: blue">After listening to the tape, write down a brief reflection in response to what you heard.</span>

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt2()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">
One nature, perfect and pervading,
circulates in all natures;

One reality, all-comprehensive,
contains within itself all realities.

The one Moon reflects itself
wherever there is a sheet of water,

And all the moons in the waters
are embraced within the one Moon.

The Absolute of all the Buddhas
enters into my own being,

And my own being is found
in union with theirs....

The Inner Light is beyond praise and blame;
Like space it knows no boundaries,

Yet it is even here, within us,
ever retaining its serenity and fullness.

It is only when you hunt for it that you lose it;

You cannot take hold of it,
but equally you cannot get rid of it,

And while you can do neither,
it goes on its own way.

You remain silent and it speaks;
you speak, and it is dumb.

The great gate of charity is wide open,
with no obstacles before it.
<br>---<br>
Yung-chia Ta-shih, circa 700

### Completing The Island
This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

**Final Journal Requirement:**

Discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle  in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle.

<!-- As you reflect on your experiences in The Witness from this week, alongside class discussion, lecture, and readings, consider including responses to the <span style="color: blue">prompts in blue</span> as a starting point, as well as your own thoughts, questions, observations, and connections.

Contemplate including in your responses observations on the puzzle mechanics and game design of the environment in this week's section of puzzles. What interesting environmental clues and insights did you uncover in this area of the game? What lessons, or creative discoveries from previous island sections may have helped or hindered your completion of this week's challenges, and in what way did they effect your understanding of this week's puzzles?

Additionally, consider how responses can include your interpretation of in-game quotes from audio recorders and how these quotes might relate to puzzles or ideas from a certain area of The Witness island. Further steps could be taken to research the famous figures behind these audio recorder quotes to learn more about their backgrounds and how their philosophies intertwine with the lessons in this game. -->
