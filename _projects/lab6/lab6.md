# **The Witness: Lab 06**

# The Jungle

Lose your way in a thicket of bamboo shoots as you contemplate the aural qualities of the jungle.

### What's The Strategy?

![Insight Image 1](captures/insight_1.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Group Discussion: These puzzles look peculiar. What do you think their solutions represent?</span>

### Confusion
Environmental distraction will make solving these puzzles tricky.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 2](captures/insight_2.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Group Discussion: Consider how you might mentally "filter" the useful puzzle clues from the distractions. What mental or physical techniques do you employ to make this process easier?</span>

### Combination
Consider this twisted tree located in the center of a maze of bamboo.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 3](captures/insight_3.jpg#capture)

<!-- Is this tree apart from the jungle, surrounded yet separate from it? Does the jungle encompass this tree, and all trees, individually, or together? How many bamboo shoots could one remove from this jungle before the jungle would cease to exist? -->

<span style="color: blue">
Group Discussion: Why do you think this curved tree is here? What symbolism does the tree convey in the context of this area?</span>

### [Lao Tzu](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/b-f-skinner)

Entering the jungle from the monastery, look to the path to discover two audio logs sitting on either side of the path. Consider this excerpt from Lao Tzu.

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">
We join spokes together in a wheel,
but it is the center hole
that makes the wagon move.

We shape clay into a pot,
but it is the emptiness inside
that holds whatever we want.

We hammer wood for a house,
but it is the inner space
that makes it livable.

We work with being,
but non-being is what we use.

<br>---<br>
Lao Tzu, 6th century BC
</div>

![Audio Log 1](captures/audio_log_1.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Reflect on this notion of "being" and "non-being". Is the jungle merely a collection of trees, or can each tree be considered individually, apart from its surroundings? How many trees could one remove from this jungle before the jungle would cease to exist?</span>

### [Sahib ibn Abbad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahib_ibn_Abbad)

Adjacent to Lao Tzu's audio log turn right to see an audio log excerpt of Sahib ibn Abbad resting off to the right of the path.  

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt2()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">
The glass is transparent,
the wine transparent —

the two are similar,
the affair confused.

There seems to be wine
and no glass,
or glass
and no wine.

### [Richard Feynman](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1913/tagore/biographical/)

This audio-log recording featuring Richard Feynman can be found along the rocky edge of an open path.

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt3()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt3" style="display:none">

If we were not able or did not desire to look in any new direction,
if we did not have a doubt or recognize ignorance,

we would not get any new ideas.  
There would be nothing worth checking,
because we would know what is true.  

So what we call scientific knowledge today
is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty.  

Some of them are most unsure; some of them are nearly sure;
but none is absolutely certain.  Scientists are used to this.  

We know that it is consistent to be able to live and not know.  

Some people say,
“How can you _live_ without knowing?” I do not know what they mean.

I always live without knowing.  That is easy.  
How you get to know is what I want to know.

This freedom to doubt is an important matter in the sciences
and, I believe, in other fields.  
It was born of a struggle.  

It was a struggle to be permitted to doubt, to be unsure.

And I do not want us to forget the importance of the struggle
and, by default, to let the thing fall away.  

I feel a responsibility as a scientist
who knows the great value
of a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance,

and the progress made possible by such a philosophy,
progress which is the fruit of freedom of thought.  

I feel a responsibility to proclaim the value of this freedom
and to teach that doubt is not to be feared,

but that it is to be welcomed
as the possibility of a new potential for human beings.

If you know that you are not sure,
you have a chance to improve the situation.  

I want to demand this freedom for future generations.

Richard Feynman, 1963

<span style="color: blue">Group Discussion: What might the yellow arrow symbol mean in the context of this puzzle?</span>

### Completing Lab 6

This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

### The Witness Journal Entry #6

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Choose one of the prompts below (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) to respond to in your journal entry.

1. ##### **Struggle and Strife**
  - ##### As you complete the jungle area, contemplate your own delights and frustrations in solving these unique puzzles.
  - ##### Do you become easily defeated when the puzzle challenge is too great? Explain.
  - ##### Does the challenge of a tough puzzle inspire you to keep trying? Explain.

2. ##### **A Philosophy of Ignorance**
  - ##### Listen to [Richard Feynman's audio log excerpt on "The Philosophy of Ignorance"](#richard-feynman).
  - ##### Do you agree or disagree with the content of this excerpt? Explain.
  - ##### In your progress through The Witness, how has your ignorance propelled you forward or held you back? Explain.

3. ##### **Difference and Distraction**
  - ##### As you advance through the jungle, consider how competing distractions make completing the puzzles difficult.
  - ##### Did you find some puzzle clues easier to understand than others? Explain.
  - ##### Discuss how you filtered the relevant information from the background noise. What challenges arose during this process?

4. ##### **Combinatorial Concepts**
  - ##### Throughout the jungle there are many puzzles that test you on similar concepts.
  - ##### In what ways are each section of these panels similar? Explain.
  - ##### What distinctions exist between each paneled section? How do these distinctions help you understand the rules of this area?

**Final Journal Requirement:**

After responding to one of the items above, discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle.
