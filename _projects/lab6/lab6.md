# The Jungle

Lose your way in a thicket of bamboo shoots as you contemplate the aural qualities of the jungle.

### What's The Strategy?

![Insight Image 1](captures/insight_1.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">These puzzles look peculiar. What do you think their solutions represent?</span>

### Confusion
Environmental distraction will make solving these puzzles tricky.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 2](captures/insight_2.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Consider how you might mentally "filter" the useful puzzle clues from the distractions. What mental or physical techniques do you employ to make this process easier?</span>

### Being and Non-being
Consider this twisted tree located in the center of a maze of bamboo.
<br><br>

<!-- Is this tree apart from the jungle, surrounded yet separate from it? Does the jungle encompass this tree, and all trees, individually, or together? How many bamboo shoots could one remove from this jungle before the jungle would cease to exist? -->

<span style="color: blue">
Why do you think this curved tree is here? What symbolism does the tree convey in the context of this area?<br><br>Is the jungle merely a collection of trees, or can each tree be considered individually, apart from its surroundings? How many trees could one remove from this jungle before the jungle would cease to exist?</span>

### [Lao Tzu](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/b-f-skinner)

Entering the jungle from the monastery, look to the path to discover two audio logs sitting on either side of the path. Consider this excerpt from Lao Tzu.

"We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move. We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want. We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable. We work with being, but non-being is what we use."

### [Richard Feynman](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1913/tagore/biographical/)

This audio-log recording featuring Richard Feynman can be found along the rocky edge of an open path.

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">

“The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist doesn’t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty damn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress, we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty — some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain. Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don’t know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question — to doubt — to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained.”

### The Witness Journal Entry #6

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Choose one of the prompts below (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) to respond to in your journal entry.

1. ##### **Hedges in Harmony**
  - ##### What challenged your understanding of the rules and mechanics of the hedge-maze area?
  - ##### How did your understanding of this area progressively change as you completed each hedge?
  - ##### Discuss your understanding of each section of the hedges. What unique lesson does each section teach you?

2. ##### **Panels and Platforms**
  - ##### In what ways are the platform puzzles similar to the hedge-maze puzzles?
  - ##### How are the platform puzzles different from other panel puzzles you have experienced in past labs?
  - ##### After completing the platform puzzles, how has your understanding of the puzzles in this game grown?

3. ##### **Statuesque Philosophies**
  - ##### Study the statues that walk the lawns of the keep.
  - ##### What thoughts go through your mind as you look at each statue?
  - ##### Identify a minimum of (3) statues in the keep that seem to relate to the conceptual understanding of the puzzles in this area, or the content of the audio-logs. Explain these relationships.

4. ##### **The Big Picture**
  - ##### In combination, what do the platform puzzles and hedge-maze puzzles attempt to teach you?
  - ##### Based on your personal experience, would you recommend the keep be completed in a specific order? Explain.
  - ##### In your opinion, what common theme exists in the keep's audio-log recordings?

**Final Journal Requirement:**

After responding to one of the items above, discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle.
