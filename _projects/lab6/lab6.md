# The Jungle

Lose your way in a thicket of bamboo shoots as you contemplate the aural qualities of the jungle.

### Aural and Visual

![Insight Image 1](captures/insight_1.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Though the puzzles in this section of the island depend mostly on auditory consideration, how might the visual details of these problems also aid in finding the solution?</span>

### Confusion
Environmental distraction will make solving these puzzles tricky.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 2](captures/insight_2.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Consider how you might mentally "filter" the useful puzzle clues from the distracting noise. What mental or physical techniques do you employ to make this process easier?</span>

### Being and Non-being
Consider this twisted tree located in the center of a maze of bamboo.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 3](captures/insight_3.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Is this tree apart from the jungle, surrounded yet separate from it? Does the jungle encompass this tree, and all trees, individually? Together? How many bamboo shoots could one remove from this jungle before the jungle would cease to exist?</span>

### [Lao Tzu](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/b-f-skinner)

Entering the jungle from the monastery, look to the path to discover two audio logs sitting on either side of the path. Consider this excerpt from Lao Tzu.

"We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move. We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want. We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable. We work with being, but non-being is what we use."

### [Richard Feynman](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1913/tagore/biographical/)

This audio-log recording featuring Richard Feynman can be found along the rocky edge of an open path.

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">

“The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist doesn’t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty damn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress, we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty — some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain. Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don’t know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question — to doubt — to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained.”
