# The Jungle

Lose your way in a thicket of bamboo shoots as you contemplate the aural qualities of the jungle.

### What's The Strategy?

![Insight Image 1](captures/insight_1.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">These puzzles look peculiar. What do you think their solutions represent?</span>

### Confusion
Environmental distraction will make solving these puzzles tricky.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 2](captures/insight_2.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Consider how you might mentally "filter" the useful puzzle clues from the distractions. What mental or physical techniques do you employ to make this process easier?</span>

### Being and Non-being
Consider this twisted tree located in the center of a maze of bamboo.
<br><br>

<!-- Is this tree apart from the jungle, surrounded yet separate from it? Does the jungle encompass this tree, and all trees, individually, or together? How many bamboo shoots could one remove from this jungle before the jungle would cease to exist? -->

<span style="color: blue">
Why do you think this curved tree is here? What symbolism does the tree convey in the context of this area?<br><br>Is the jungle merely a collection of trees, or can each tree be considered individually, apart from its surroundings? How many trees could one remove from this jungle before the jungle would cease to exist?</span>

### [Lao Tzu](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/b-f-skinner)

Entering the jungle from the monastery, look to the path to discover two audio logs sitting on either side of the path. Consider this excerpt from Lao Tzu.

"We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move. We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want. We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable. We work with being, but non-being is what we use."

Lao Tzu

### [Richard Feynman](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1913/tagore/biographical/)

This audio-log recording featuring Richard Feynman can be found along the rocky edge of an open path.

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">

“The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist doesn’t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty damn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress, we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty — some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain. Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don’t know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question — to doubt — to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained.”

### Completing Lab 6

This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

### Bonus Puzzle

### Journal Assignment

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Your journal entry must include discussions on at least (2) of the following:

- ##### Any one of the <span style="color: blue">blue prompts</span> from this lab
- ##### Something that you found confusing
- ##### A discovery you made about the nature of the island
- ##### An "aha!" moment you had while solving any of the puzzles
- ##### Do you have a theory on what the purpose of this game is? Explain it.
- ##### Describe an aspect of the environment that improved your understanding of the puzzles.
- ##### Are any of the audio logs meaningful to you? If yes, explain why.

**Final Journal Requirement:**

Discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. How does this puzzle work? If it helps, feel free to include a screenshot or sketch of the puzzle.

<!-- As you reflect on your experiences in The Witness from this week, alongside class discussion, lecture, and readings, consider including responses to the <span style="color: blue">prompts in blue</span> as a starting point, as well as your own thoughts, questions, observations, and connections.

Contemplate including in your responses observations on the puzzle mechanics and game design of the environment in this week's section of puzzles. What interesting environmental clues and insights did you uncover in this area of the game? What lessons, or creative discoveries from previous island sections may have helped or hindered your completion of this week's challenges, and in what way did they effect your understanding of this week's puzzles?

Additionally, consider how responses can include your interpretation of in-game quotes from audio recorders and how these quotes might relate to puzzles or ideas from a certain area of The Witness island. Further steps could be taken to research the famous figures behind these audio recorder quotes to learn more about their backgrounds and how their philosophies intertwine with the lessons in this game. -->
