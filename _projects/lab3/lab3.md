- ##### **Experiencing An "Aha!" Moment**
  - ##### Did you have an "Aha!" moment while you were attempting to solve any particular puzzle? Describe the moment when you finally figured it out.
  - ##### How do you think other puzzles in the area informed your approach to solving this one?
  - ##### How has your perception and understanding of the puzzle changed once you found the solution?

- ##### **Partial Solutions**
  - ##### In what ways do the puzzles in this area prevent you from seeing the whole solution all at once?
  - ##### What behavior does this lack of information evoke in you as you attempt to solve these puzzles?
  - ##### How did you manipulate the state of the environment to improve your chances of finding a puzzle solution?

- ##### **A Puzzling Puzzle**
  - ##### After reflecting on a puzzle in this area, what was most confusing about it and why? Are there still aspects of the puzzle you don't understand? Explain.
  - ##### What approaches or techniques did you use to improve your understanding of the puzzle?
  - ##### Describe the feelings you experienced as you worked through your confusion to ultimately solve the puzzle.

- ##### **Layering Lessons**
  - ##### Consider each puzzle-floor as you descend further and further into the desert ruins.
  - ##### Can you identify a specific lesson that each of these floors intends to teach you?
  - ##### How do lessons from one floor inform your approach to puzzles on other floors?

- ##### **Unseen, Unsolved**
