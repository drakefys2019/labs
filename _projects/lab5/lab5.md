# The Keep

Adjacent to the shaded section of trees, an echoing tunnel entrance leads to the pristine gardens of The Keep. Various figurines caught in frozen motion adorn the grounds. Not everything is as it appears to be.

### Vantage
Sometimes a puzzle can be best scene from a different vantage point.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 1](captures/insight_1.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">How does adjusting your point of view help you find solutions to some of these puzzles?</span>

### Visual Detail
Notice how this panel is broken.
<br><br>
![Insight Image 2](captures/insight_2.jpg#capture)

<span style="color: blue">Does the variety of landscape features and obstructions in the environment help you identify the puzzle solutions more easily? Do these landmarks present additional challenges? How might you improvise if the optimal solution is unattainable?</span>

### Auditory Detail
As you walk through this dimly lit entrance into the keep, consider how the echoes of your footsteps become acutely noticeable.

### [B. F. Skinner](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/b-f-skinner)

An audio log excerpt from B.F. Skinner's 1971 book, ["Beyond Freedom and Dignity"](https://selfdefinition.org/psychology/BF-Skinner-Beyond-Freedom-&-Dignity-1971.pdf), can be found just to the right of this spilled bucket.

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">
"In the traditional view a person is free.
He is autonomous in the sense that his behavior is uncaused...

That view, together with its associated practices,
must be re-examined when a scientific analysis

reveals unexpected controlling relations
between behavior and environment....

By questioning the control exercised by autonomous man
and demonstrating the control exercised by the environment,

a science of behavior also seems to question dignity or worth.

A person is responsible for his behavior,
not only in the sense that he may be
justly blamed or punished when he behaves badly,

but also in the sense that he is to be given credit
and admired for his achievements.

A scientific analysis shifts the credit as well as the blame
to the environment,
and traditional practices can then no longer be justified.

These are sweeping changes,
and those who are committed to traditional theories and practices
naturally resist them....

As the emphasis shifts to the environment,
the individual seems to be exposed
to a new kind of danger.

Who is to construct the controlling environment
and to what end?

Autonomous man presumably controls himself
in accordance with a built-in set of values;
and will it be good for those he controls?

Answers to questions of this sort are said, of course,
to call for value judgements."

### [Rabindranath Tagore](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1913/tagore/biographical/)

This audio-log recording featuring Rabindranath Tagore can be found atop the amplifier near this guitarist statue.

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">

I boasted among men that I had known you.

They see your pictures in all works of mine.
They come and ask me, "Who is he?"

I know not how to answer them.
I say, "Indeed, I cannot tell."

They blame me and they go away in scorn.
And you sit there smiling.

I put my tales of you into lasting songs.
The secret gushes out from my heart.

They come and ask me,
"Tell me all your meanings."

I know not how to answer them.
I say, "Ah, who knows what they mean!"

They smile and go away in utter scorn.
And you sit there smiling.

### Completing Lab 5

This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

### Journal Assignment

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Your journal entry must include discussions on at least (2) of the following:

- ##### Any one of the <span style="color: blue">blue prompts</span> from this lab
- ##### Something that you found confusing
- ##### A discovery you made about the nature of the island
- ##### An "aha!" moment you had while solving any of the puzzles
- ##### Do you have a theory on what the purpose of this game is? Explain it.
- ##### Describe an aspect of the environment that improved your understanding of the puzzles.
- ##### Are any of the audio logs meaningful to you? If yes, explain why.

**Final Journal Requirement:**

Discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. How does this puzzle work? If it helps, feel free to include a screenshot or sketch of the puzzle.

<!-- As you reflect on your experiences in The Witness from this week, alongside class discussion, lecture, and readings, consider including responses to the <span style="color: blue">prompts in blue</span> as a starting point, as well as your own thoughts, questions, observations, and connections.

Contemplate including in your responses observations on the puzzle mechanics and game design of the environment in this week's section of puzzles. What interesting environmental clues and insights did you uncover in this area of the game? What lessons, or creative discoveries from previous island sections may have helped or hindered your completion of this week's challenges, and in what way did they effect your understanding of this week's puzzles?

Additionally, consider how responses can include your interpretation of in-game quotes from audio recorders and how these quotes might relate to puzzles or ideas from a certain area of The Witness island. Further steps could be taken to research the famous figures behind these audio recorder quotes to learn more about their backgrounds and how their philosophies intertwine with the lessons in this game. -->
