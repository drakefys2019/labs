# **The Witness: Lab 04**

![Header Image 1](captures/header.jpg#header)
# The Keep

Adjacent to the shady trees, an echoing tunnel entrance leads to the pristine gardens of The Keep. Various statues caught in frozen motion adorn the grounds. Not everything is as it appears to be.

### Puzzling Transformations
Pay attention to what occurs on the puzzle panel when you step into this area.

### [B. F. Skinner](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/b-f-skinner)

An audio log excerpt from B.F. Skinner's 1971 book, ["Beyond Freedom and Dignity"](https://selfdefinition.org/psychology/BF-Skinner-Beyond-Freedom-&-Dignity-1971.pdf), can be found just to the right of this spilled bucket.

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">
"In the traditional view a person is free.
He is autonomous in the sense that his behavior is uncaused...

That view, together with its associated practices,
must be re-examined when a scientific analysis

reveals unexpected controlling relations
between behavior and environment....

By questioning the control exercised by autonomous man
and demonstrating the control exercised by the environment,

a science of behavior also seems to question dignity or worth.

A person is responsible for his behavior,
not only in the sense that he may be
justly blamed or punished when he behaves badly,

but also in the sense that he is to be given credit
and admired for his achievements.

A scientific analysis shifts the credit as well as the blame
to the environment,
and traditional practices can then no longer be justified.

These are sweeping changes,
and those who are committed to traditional theories and practices
naturally resist them....

As the emphasis shifts to the environment,
the individual seems to be exposed
to a new kind of danger.

Who is to construct the controlling environment
and to what end?

Autonomous man presumably controls himself
in accordance with a built-in set of values;
and will it be good for those he controls?

Answers to questions of this sort are said, of course,
to call for value judgements."

This audio-log recording featuring Rabindranath Tagore can be found atop the amplifier near this guitarist statue.

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">

I boasted among men that I had known you.

They see your pictures in all works of mine.
They come and ask me, "Who is he?"

I know not how to answer them.
I say, "Indeed, I cannot tell."

They blame me and they go away in scorn.
And you sit there smiling.

I put my tales of you into lasting songs.
The secret gushes out from my heart.

They come and ask me,
"Tell me all your meanings."

I know not how to answer them.
I say, "Ah, who knows what they mean!"

They smile and go away in utter scorn.
And you sit there smiling.

### Completing Lab 5

This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

### The Witness Journal Entry #5

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Choose one of the prompts below (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) to respond to in your journal entry.

1. ##### **Hedges in Harmony**
  - ##### What challenged your understanding of the rules and mechanics of the hedge-maze area?
  - ##### How did your understanding of this area progressively change as you completed each hedge?
  - ##### Discuss your understanding of each section of the hedges. What unique lesson does each section teach you?

2. ##### **Panels and Platforms**
  - ##### In what ways are the platform puzzles similar to the hedge-maze puzzles?
  - ##### How are the platform puzzles different from other panel puzzles you have experienced in past labs?
  - ##### After completing the platform puzzles, how has your understanding of the puzzles in this game grown?

3. ##### **Statuesque Philosophies**
  - ##### Study the statues that walk the lawns of the keep.
  - ##### What thoughts go through your mind as you look at each statue?
  - ##### Identify a minimum of (3) statues in the keep that seem to relate to the conceptual understanding of the puzzles in this area, or the content of the audio-logs. Explain these relationships.

4. ##### **The Big Picture**
  - ##### In combination, what do the platform puzzles and hedge-maze puzzles attempt to teach you?
  - ##### Based on your personal experience, would you recommend the keep be completed in a specific order? Explain.
  - ##### In your opinion, what common theme exists in the keep's audio-log recordings?

**Final Journal Requirement:**

After responding to one of the items above, discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle.
