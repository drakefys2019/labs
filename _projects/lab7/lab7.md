### Coalescent Colors
There are many vibrantly hued plants scattered on and across the greenhouse.

### [Arthur Eddington](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/b-f-skinner)

Find a way to access this primary green level to hear a musing by Arthur Eddington and his thoughts on the people of [Laputa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laputa).

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">
As scientists, we realise that colour is merely a question
of the wavelengths of aethereal vibrations,

but that does not seem to have dispelled the feeling
that eyes which reflect light near wavelength 4800
are a subject for rhapsody

whilst those which reflect wavelength 5300
are left unsung.

We have not yet reached the practice of the Laputans, who,
“if they would, for example, praise the beauty of a
woman, or any other animal,

they describe it by rhombs, circles,
parallelograms, ellipses, and other geometrical terms.”

The materialist who is convinced that all phenomena
arise from electrons and quanta and the like
controlled by mathematical formulae,

must presumably hold the belief
that his wife is a rather elaborate differential equation,

but he is probably tactful enough
not to obtrude this opinion in domestic life.

If this kind of scientific dissection
is felt to be inadequate and irrelevant
in ordinary personal relationships,

it is surely out of place
in the most personal relationship of all —
that of the human soul to a divine spirit.

Arthur Eddington, 1927

### Completing Lab 7

This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

### The Witness Journal Entry #7

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Choose one of the prompts below (either 1, 2, or 3) to respond to in your journal entry.

1. ##### **Alternate Perceptions**
  - ##### Detail your procedure for solving the puzzles on the first floor of the greenhouse.
  - ##### What environmental clues aided or hindered your completion of this section of the greenhouse? Explain.
  - ##### How does the level of difficulty change when you perceive the problem in a different light?

2. ##### **An Elevated Experience**
  - ##### Contemplate the puzzle challenges built into the elevator sequence in the greenhouse.
  - ##### What lesson(s) does this section of the area convey to you? Explain.
  - ##### What information is "lost" because of the broken power line? How did you "regain" this information?

3. ##### **A Theory of Color**
  - ##### Does the greenhouse help players to understand [color theory](https://colormatters.com/color-and-design/basic-color-theory)? Explain.
  - ##### What previous lessons from The Witness, in combination with lessons learned from this area, helped you to complete these puzzles?
  - ##### Consider [Arthur Eddington's thoughts](#arthur-eddington) on perceiving the World through purely scientific means. Can life be summarized solely through scientific measurement, such as the wavelength of light? Discuss your thoughts on this.

**Final Journal Requirement:**

After responding to one of the items above, discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle.
