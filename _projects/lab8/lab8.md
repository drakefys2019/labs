### Effaced Assumptions
As you navigate through the increasingly complex puzzles of the swamp area, consider how your understanding of the rules morphs over time.

### Terrain Manipulation
Progress in the swamp is dependent on your ability to transform the topography.

### [Arthur Eddington](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/b-f-skinner)

Peruse the coastal perimeter of the swamp to discover this audio log excerpt by Arthur Eddington on the nature of intimate and symbolic knowledge.

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">

We have two kinds of knowledge which I call symbolic and intimate.

I do not know whether it would be correct to say
that reasoning is only applicable to symbolic knowledge,

but the more customary forms of reasoning
have been developed for symbolic knowledge only.

The intimate knowledge will not submit to codification and analysis,
or, rather, when we attempt to analyse it
the intimacy is lost and replaced by symbolism.

For an illustration let us consider Humour.

I suppose that humour can be analysed to some extent
and the essential ingredients
of the different kinds of wit classified.

Suppose that we are offered an alleged joke.
We subject it to scientific analysis
as we would a chemical salt of doubtful nature,

and perhaps after careful consideration
we are able to confirm
that it really and truly is a joke.

Logically, I suppose, our next procedure would be to laugh.

But it may certainly be predicted
that as the result of this scrutiny
we shall have lost all inclination we ever had
to laugh at it.

It simply does not do to expose the workings of a joke.

The classification concerns a symbolic knowledge of humour
which preserves all the characteristics of a joke
except its laughableness.

The real appreciation must come spontaneously,
not introspectively.

I think this is a not unfair analogy
for our mystical feeling for Nature,

and I would venture even to apply it
to our mystical experience of God.

There are some to whom the sense
of a divine presence irradiating the soul
is one of the most obvious things of experience.

In their view, a man without this sense
is to be regarded
as we regard a man without a sense of humour.

The absence is a kind of mental deficiency.

We may try to analyse the experience as we analyse humour,
and construct a theology,
or it may be an atheistic philosophy...

But let us not forget that the theology is symbolic knowledge,
whereas the experience is intimate knowledge.

And as laughter cannot be compelled
by the scientific exposition of the structure of a joke,

so a philosophic discussion of the attributes of God
(or an impersonal substitute)

is likely to miss the intimate response of the spirit
which is the central point of the religious experience.

Arthur Eddington, 1927

### [Zhuangzi](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zhuangzi/)

Navigate the small boat towards the Jungle to catch a glimpse of an audio log excerpt by Zhuangzi tucked away in a derelect shipwreck.

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt2()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">

Suppose a boat is crossing a river,
and another empty boat is about to collide with it.

Even an irritable man would not lose his temper.

But supposing there was some one in the second boat.
Then the occupant of the first
would shout to him to keep clear.

And if the other did not hear the first time,
nor even when called three times,
bad language would inevitably follow.

In the first case there was no anger,
in the second there was;

because in the first case the boat was empty,
and in the second it was occupied.

And so it is with man.
If he could only roam empty through life,
who would be able to injure him?

Zhuangzi, 4th century B.C.

### Completing Lab 8

This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

### The Witness Journal Entry #8

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Choose one of the prompts below (either 1, 2, or 3) to respond to in your journal entry.

1. ##### **Assurance in Understanding**
  - ##### Consider [Arthur Eddington's explanation](#arthur-eddington) of intimate and symbolic knowledge.
  - ##### In what ways does the swamp teach you how to solve puzzles without specifically pronouncing the rules?
  - ##### Discuss a specific puzzle, or section of puzzles, in the swamp that, upon completion, gave you insight over the rules that govern this area.

2. ##### **Prior Knowledge Applied**
  - ##### Consider the shift in approach you had to invoke for the underwater sections of the swamp.
  - ##### Did you find these puzzles easier to solve after acquiring a deeper understanding from the panels above? Explain.
  - ##### What in particular makes these submerged puzzles challenging to solve? Explain.

3. ##### **A Fluid Methodology**
  - ##### Many of the puzzles in the swamp require multiple attempts before the solution is found.
  - ##### Explain the procedures you used to solve the puzzles in any area of the swamp. Did you sketch, guess and check, visualize solutions in your mind, etc.?
  - ##### What processes seemed to be the most effective for solving the problems? Explain why.

**Final Journal Requirement:**

After responding to one of the items above, discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle.
