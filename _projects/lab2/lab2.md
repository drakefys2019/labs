# Desert Ruins

Just North of Symmetry Island, a bleached pile of ruins sits smoldering in the bright sunlight.

### Catching Reflected Light
As you traverse the desert ruins, consider how reflected light plays a role in solving this area's puzzles.

### Controlling Machinery
Many of the puzzles in this area can be more easily solved by activating the technology in the environment. Try adjusting this monitor's position by controlling this switch.

### [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)

Climb atop a shiny structure to the north of the main ruins to discover an audio log excerpt of Albert Einstein reflecting on "cosmic religious feeling".

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt1()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none">

"I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling
is the strongest and the noblest motive for scientific research.
Only those who realize the immense efforts
and, above all, the devotion
without which pioneer work in theoretical science
cannot be achieved
are able to grasp the strength of the emotion
out of which alone such work,
remote as it is from the immediate realities of life, can issue.
What a deep conviction of the rationality of the universe
and what a yearning to understand,
were it but a feeble reflection
of the mind revealed in this world,
Kepler and Newton must have had
to enable them to spend years of solitary labor
in disentangling the principles of celestial mechanics!
Those whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results
easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality
of the men who, surrounded by a skeptical world,
have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered wide
through the world and through the centuries.
Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends
can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men
and given them strength to remain true to their purpose
in spite of countless failures.
It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man such strength.
A contemporary has said, not unjustly
that in this materialistic age of ours
the serious scientific workers
are the only profoundly religious people."

### Completing The Island
This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!
