# The Treehouse

Branching pathways twist through stoic tree tops in this unfolding labyrinth above the forest floor.

### Terrain Manipulation
Progress in the swamp is dependent on your ability to transform the topography.

Lustily  
I dipped my oars into the silent lake,  
And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat  
Went heaving through the water like a swan;  
When, from behind that craggy steep, till then  
The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,  
As if with voluntary power instinct,  
Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,  
And growing still in stature, the grim shape  
Towered up between me and the stars. . . .  
But after I had seen  
That spectacle, for many days my brain  
Worked with a dim and undetermined sense  
Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts  
There hung a darkness, call it solitude,  
Or blank desertion.

God bade me behold the sea,
and I saw the ships sinking
and the planks floating;

then the planks too were submerged.

And God said to me,
“Those who voyage are not saved.”

And He said to me, “Those who, instead of voyaging,
cast themselves into the sea, take a risk.”

And He said to me,
“Those who voyage and take no risk shall perish.”

And He said to me,
“In taking the risk there is a part of salvation.”

And the wave came
and lifted those beneath it
and overran the shore.

And He said to me,
“The surface of the sea is a gleam that cannot be reached.

“And the bottom is a darkness impenetrable. And between
the two are great fishes, which are to be feared.”

<div id="excerpt3" style="display:none" markdown="1">

These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,  
Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.  

The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs,  
And sunset, and the colours of the earth.  

These had seen movement, and heard music; known  
Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;  

Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;  
Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended.  

There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter  
And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after,  

Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance  
And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white  

Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance,  
A width, a shining peace, under the night.

When we choose silence,
we choose to give up the reasons not to love,

which are the reasons for going to war, or continuing war,
or separating, or being a victim, or being right.

In a moment of silence,
in a moment of no thought, no mind,

we choose to give those up.
This is what my teacher invited me to.

Just choose silence. Don't even choose love.
Choose silence, and love is apparent.

If we choose love we already have an idea
of what love is.

But if you choose silence, that is the end of ideas.
You are willing to have no idea,

to see what is present when there is no idea,
past, present, future.

No idea of love, no idea of truth, no idea of you,
no idea of me. Love is apparent.

### Completing Lab 9

This part of the island is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires into the sky. Nice work!

### The Witness Journal Entry #9

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Choose one of the prompts below (either 1, 2, or 3) to respond to in your journal entry.

1. ##### **Assurance in Understanding**
  - ##### Consider [Arthur Eddington's explanation](#arthur-eddington) of intimate and symbolic knowledge.
  - ##### In what ways does the swamp teach you how to solve puzzles without specifically pronouncing the rules?
  - ##### Discuss a specific puzzle, or section of puzzles, in the swamp that, upon completion, gave you insight over the rules that govern this area.

2. ##### **Prior Knowledge Applied**
  - ##### Consider the shift in approach you had to invoke for the underwater sections of the swamp.
  - ##### Did you find these puzzles easier to solve after acquiring a deeper understanding from the panels above? Explain.
  - ##### What in particular makes these submerged puzzles challenging to solve? Explain.

3. ##### **A Fluid Methodology**
  - ##### Many of the puzzles in the swamp require multiple attempts before the solution is found.
  - ##### Explain the procedures you used to solve the puzzles in any area of the swamp. Did you sketch, guess and check, visualize solutions in your mind, etc.?
  - ##### What processes seemed to be the most effective for solving the problems? Explain why.

**Final Journal Requirement:**

After responding to one of the items above, discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle.
