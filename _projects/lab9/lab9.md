### [William Wordsworth](https://poets.org/poet/william-wordsworth)

Approaching the treehouse from the swamp, keep a keen eye out for this poetic excerpt by William Wordsworth.

<div id="excerpt1" style="display:none" markdown="1">

Lustily  
I dipped my oars into the silent lake,  
And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat  
Went heaving through the water like a swan;  
When, from behind that craggy steep, till then  
The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,  
As if with voluntary power instinct,  
Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,  
And growing still in stature, the grim shape  
Towered up between me and the stars. . . .  
But after I had seen  
That spectacle, for many days my brain  
Worked with a dim and undetermined sense  
Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts  
There hung a darkness, call it solitude,  
Or blank desertion.

<br>---<br>
William Wordsworth, 1888

Stare into the murky abyss as you contemplate this audio log excerpt by Muhammad Ibn’Abdi’l-Jabbar Al-Niffari.

<div id="excerpt2" style="display:none">

God bade me behold the sea,
and I saw the ships sinking
and the planks floating;

then the planks too were submerged.

And God said to me,
“Those who voyage are not saved.”

And He said to me, “Those who, instead of voyaging,
cast themselves into the sea, take a risk.”

And He said to me,
“Those who voyage and take no risk shall perish.”

And He said to me,
“In taking the risk there is a part of salvation.”

And the wave came
and lifted those beneath it
and overran the shore.

And He said to me,
“The surface of the sea is a gleam that cannot be reached.

“And the bottom is a darkness impenetrable. And between
the two are great fishes, which are to be feared.”

Niffari, circa 970

Gaze upon the prismatic colors of this ocean view as you absorb an audio log excerpt by Rupert Brooke.

<div id="excerpt3" style="display:none" markdown="1">

These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,  
Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.  

The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs,  
And sunset, and the colours of the earth.  

These had seen movement, and heard music; known  
Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;  

Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;  
Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended.  

There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter  
And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after,  

Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance  
And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white  

Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance,  
A width, a shining peace, under the night.

Rupert Brooke, 1914

### [Gangaji](https://gangaji.org/)

Rearrange the green pathway to spot this audio log excerpt by Gangaji tucked into the crevice of a treehouse structure.

<button onclick="collapseExcerpt4()">View Excerpt</button>

<div id="excerpt4" style="display:none">

When we choose silence,
we choose to give up the reasons not to love,

which are the reasons for going to war, or continuing war,
or separating, or being a victim, or being right.

In a moment of silence,
in a moment of no thought, no mind,

we choose to give those up.
This is what my teacher invited me to.

Just choose silence. Don't even choose love.
Choose silence, and love is apparent.

If we choose love we already have an idea
of what love is.

But if you choose silence, that is the end of ideas.
You are willing to have no idea,

to see what is present when there is no idea,
past, present, future.

No idea of love, no idea of truth, no idea of you,
no idea of me. Love is apparent.

Gangaji, 2009

### The Witness Journal Entry #9

Write a journal entry on what you learned from this lab. Pretend that you are a scientist exploring this island for the very first time. Choose one of the prompts below (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) to respond to in your journal entry.

1. ##### **Prominent Experience**

    - ##### Find and listen to all 4 audio log excerpts found in this area: (Note that some audio logs are hidden behind locked panels or alternate pathways.)
      - [William Wordsworth](#william-wordsworth)
      - [Niffari](#niffari)
      - [Rupert Brooke](#rupert-brooke)
      - [Gangaji](#gangaji)

    - ##### How does your chosen excerpt relate to your experience solving the treehouse puzzles? Explain.
    - ##### In what way does your chosen excerpt relate to your experience thus far playing The Witness? Explain.

2. ##### **Bridges to Understanding**
  - ##### The treehouse area has many lessons to teach. Discuss an insight you gained from completing the treehouse that has helped you to understand previous sections of the game you found confusing.
  - ##### How does the process of completing any bridge in the treehouse help to cement your understanding of the rules?
  - ##### Discuss a specific bridge in the treehouse area, why you found it particularly challenging, and what strategies lead to your ability to complete this section.

3. ##### **A False Impression**
  - ##### Describe a section of puzzles in the treehouse that turned out to be solvable in a way you first assumed would not work.
  - ##### Explain what first lead you to assume certain rules applied.
  - ##### How do the rules of this puzzle differ from your expectations? Explain.

4. ##### **Enigmatic Symbolism**
  - ##### Each section in the treehouse is full of symbolic combinations. Please list each symbol you encountered in completing the treehouse, and what rules each symbol conveys.
  - ##### For any given puzzle, how do the combinations of symbols add to the complexity of finding the solution?
  - ##### Describe a specific puzzle where the presence of certain symbols inhibited solving it in an ideal way or directed you toward a unique solution.

**Final Journal Requirement:**

After responding to one of the items above, discuss the solution to a particular puzzle that challenged you. Explain the mechanics of this puzzle in detail and how you came to understand them. If it helps, feel free to include screenshots or sketches of the puzzle.
